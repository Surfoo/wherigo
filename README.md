Wherigo
=======

Some open source Wherigo cartridges for understand how it works.

How can you help ?
=======

If you want, you can share your cartridges to help the geocaching community.
Of course, you should remove all sensible informations like coordinates, answers or what you want you think is too important for your cartridge.
You can also write a small documentation with the [Mardown syntax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for a better reading in the browser.

Then, you can send an email to surfooo at gmail dot com with your cartridge and documentation. If you know how to make a pull request on this repository, it really cool!
